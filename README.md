# Assignment 3.6 Unit Testing Your API

Write unit test using Jest for API

Write 2 tests for each 
```
-API with the endpoint the returns limited data based on a query string and select.
-API that returns the pagination of the collection. Test the skip and limit of the endpoint.
-Endpoint that returns your collection sorted. Test the sort in both directions
```

All tests should pass when run with and without mocked services.

All APIs are different, check result in Postman.
